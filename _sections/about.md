Hi! I'm Cyril Focht, a Master's student in computational media at the University of California Santa Cruz. My research is in interactive narrative, and I'm writing my thesis on choice poetics and approaches to narrative point of view that aren't centered on player agency. As an arts practice I mostly make games and interactive pieces about mysticism, drawing inspiration from traditional and modern works by mystic writers and artists.
