Hi! I'm Cyril Focht, a Master's student in computational media at the University of California Santa Cruz. My primary research interest is in aesthetics of interaction, how we construct meaning from interaction, and how that can be applied to how game mechanics can be used to convey deeper meaning. My other main research interest is in interactive paradox, paradoxes which arise from interaction with a system, and how this form of paradox can be used as a form of poetics within games, much like Sufi and Daoist poetry.
